## Instructions

To compile my code, type:

```
$ make compile
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ make run
```

/To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

## Time Difference
For large files, the time for Step 1 is generally shorter than Step 2
    This may be because Step 1 compares each char in the first file to
    the second file individually, whereas Step 2 creates two arrays
    then compares the chars in either array. Step 2 includes another step
    and more memory usage which is why it takes longer than Step 1 in our
    project.
